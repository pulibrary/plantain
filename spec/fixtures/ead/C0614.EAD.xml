        <emph render="bold">Biography of Francis Preston Blair</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876), journalist and politician, was born in Abingdon, Virginia, and raised in Kentucky. His grandfather, John Blair, held the first chair in theology at Princeton University. He graduated from Transylvania University in 1811 and married Eliza Violet Gist (1733-1877) a year later. Blair was admitted to the bar in 1817 but never practiced law. He became interested in Kentucky politics joining the New Court party and aiding his political ally, Amos Kendall, in editing the 
      <emph render="italic">Argus of Western America</emph>and the 
      <emph render="italic">Patriot</emph>in Frankfort. Blair became an advocate of Andrew Jackson, and on the advice of Kendall, Jackson called him to Washington in 1830 to become editor of the 
      <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, which became the official newspaper of the administration. A loyal Jacksonian, Blair was a confidential member of the Kitchen Cabinet and served Jackson faithfully from 1830 through 1837. The 
      <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>continued to be a powerful voice through the Van Buren administration (1837-1841). Blair was forced to resign in 1845 by the new president, James K. Polk.</p>
      <p>Retiring to his country estate, Silver Spring, in Maryland, Blair continued to exercise political power and influence, often through his sons, Francis "Frank" Preston (1821-1875) and Montgomery (1813-1883).</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Biography of Samuel Phillips Lee</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Samuel Phillips Lee (1812-1897), an officer in the United States Navy, was born in Fairfax, Virginia, the son of Francis Lightfoot Lee, grandson of Richard Henry Lee, and great nephew of Francis Lightfoot Lee, both signers of the Declaration of Independence. In 1825 he was appointed a midshipman and proceeded to work his way through the ranks, becoming a rear-admiral in 1870. When commanding the 
      <emph render="italic">Dolphin</emph>in 1851, Lee was employed in coastal survey duty making deep-sea soundings, testing currents, and searching for shallow ocean spots. His report of this work, 
      <emph render="italic">The Cruise of the Dolphin</emph>(1854), was of considerable help to Matthew F. Maury, the oceanographer. During the Civil War, Lee remained loyal to the Union and participated in the Charleston blockade, the attack on New Orleans, and the battle of Vicksburg, and commanded both the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and the Mississippi Squadron. After the war, he served at various posts, and his last command was as head of the North Atlantic fleet (1870-1872). In 1873 he retired from the navy.</p>
      <p>While a young officer, Lee courted Elizabeth Blair Lee (1818-1906), the only daughter of Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876). After a lengthy courtship, Elizabeth Blair and Samuel Phillips Lee were married in 1843. Their only child, (Francis Preston) Blair Lee, was born in 1857. The family lived in Washington and at Silver Spring, Maryland, the country estate of Francis Preston Blair. After his retirement from the navy, Lee ran the day-to-day activities of the farm, and it was there that he died in 1897.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Biography of Elizabeth Blair Lee</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Elizabeth Blair Lee (1818-1906), the only daughter of Francis Preston Blair and Eliza Violet Gist Blair, grew up in Washington, D.C., and Silver Spring, Maryland, immersed in the politics of the day. A favorite of Andrew Jackson, "Lizzie" lived in the White House for a time to please him. After she married Samuel Phillips Lee, a naval officer, in 1843, she often wrote to him keeping him up to date not only on family matters but also on local and national politics. She actively gathered this information through the comments of her father, editor of the Democratic organ, the 
      <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, and her brothers, Montgomery Blair, postmaster general under Lincoln, and Francis "Frank" Preston Blair, Jr., a general in the Civil War. Her political role also included serving as her father's amanuensis and sometime ghostwriter of his speeches.</p>
      <p>Aside from being an avid follower of the political scene, Elizabeth Blair Lee spent much of her time raising her only child, (Francis Preston) Blair Lee, born in 1857; meeting the obligations of a large extended family; and participating in the busy social scene in Washington and Maryland. She also served for many years as a director of the Washington City Orphan Asylum. In 1906, Elizabeth Blair Lee died at Silver Spring where she had lived with her son and his family.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Biography of Andrew Alexander Blair</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Andrew Alexander Blair (1848-1932), son of Francis "Frank" Preston Blair, Jr., and grandson of Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876), graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1866, being the youngest graduate to complete the full course up until that time. He served in the navy for two years and then resigned because of illness. Blair then became an analytical chemist and was a founding member of the firm of Booth, Garrett and Blair. He was well-known in his field, publishing many papers and reports.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Biography of Blair Lee</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Blair Lee (1857-1944), lawyer, legislator and social reformer, was born in Silver Spring, Maryland, the only child of Samuel Phillips Lee and Elizabeth Blair. He was educated at Princeton University (Class of 1880), where he was a founding member and president of the Ivy Club, and at Columbian (now George Washington) Law School earning a law degree in 1883. A practicing attorney in Washington, D.C., and Maryland, Lee also participated in Democratic politics, an interest which had been nurtured by his mother and grandfather, Francis Preston Blair (1791-1876). He was twice elected to the Maryland State Senate (1905 and 1909), and among his accomplishments there was the passage of legislation establishing the primary law for party nominations and the creation of the Maryland State Roads Commission. Although narrowly defeated in 1911 in a race for governor of Maryland, Lee was elected to the United States Senate in 1913, the first senator elected under the 17th Amendment, in a special election following the death of Isidor Rayner. While in the United States Senate, he was active in passing legislation such as the Farm Loan Law, the amending of the Federal Reserve Law, and the Hay-Wadsworth Bill. A delegate to eight Democratic national conventions, he worked actively for the election of William Jennings Bryan (1896 and 1900) and Woodrow Wilson (1912 and 1916).</p>
      <p>In 1891 he married Anne Clymer Brooke and, after her death (1903), helped raise their sons, Edward Brooke Lee (1892-1984, Princeton Class 1916) and Phillips Blair Lee (1895-1983, Princeton Class of 1918). Lee's interests included social reform and philanthropy, and he was active in the National Junior Republic, National Mary Washington Memorial Association, and the Washington City Orphan Asylum. He also participated in fraternal groups such as the Society of the Cincinnati in the State of Virginia, the Princeton Class of 1880 and the Ivy Club, and the K.F.R. Society.</p>

          <p>The papers of Francis Preston Blair, journalist and politician, consist of writings, correspondence, documents, materials regarding Blair as a subject, printed matter, papers of other persons, and additional papers. The writings include his speeches, editorials, addresses, articles, essays, and general works; these date from 1830, when Blair was called to Washington, D.C., by President Andrew Jackson to edit the 
          <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, the official newspaper of the Democratic administration. Although he never held an elected office, Blair was considered a person of political importance and influence in the mid-19th century, and his correspondence is indicative of this, containing letters from Andrew Jackson (1767-1845), Martin Van Buren (1782-1862), and Andrew Johnson (1808-1875), as well as senators Lewis Cass (1782-1866), John Charles Fremont (1813-1890), and John Jordan Crittenden (1787-1863), and congressmen Schuyler Colfax (1823-1885), Edward Livingston (1764-1836), and Thomas Patrick Moore (1797-1853).</p>
          <p>Also included is family correspondence, especially with his sons, Francis "Frank" Preston Blair, Jr. (1821-1875, Princeton Class of 1841), lawyer, general, and politician, and Montgomery Blair (1813-1883), lawyer, statesman, and postmaster general in President Abraham Lincoln's cabinet, and daughter, Elizabeth Blair Lee, wife of Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee and mother of Blair Lee.</p>
          <p>In addition, there are documents including Blair's last will and testament, financial papers such as receipts, checks, checkbooks, and account books. Among papers of others persons, there is correspondence of Andrew Jackson, manuscripts contributed to the 
          <emph render="italic">Globe</emph>, and old family papers, many of them relating to the family of Eliza Violet Gist, Blair's wife.</p>
