The office files, maintained at Morrison's offices at SUNY Albany and later Princeton University, document Morrison's activities, including awards, conferences, lectures, interviews, etc., throughout her career as a public figure. The office files also include subject files pertaining to her publishers, literary agency, various professional organizations, and individuals; letterbooks of administrative correspondence sent by Morrison and her assistants, various requests received, and fan mail.
