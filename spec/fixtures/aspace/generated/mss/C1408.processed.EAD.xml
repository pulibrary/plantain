    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Tēlemachos Alaveras was born on September 30, 1926 in Plovdiv, Eastern Rumelia (now Bulgaria). The following year his family moved to Thessalonikē, a city they were destined never to leave. The writer appears in the literature with stories in magazines, and soon he asserts himself and becomes famous all over Greece. In 1952 he issued his first book, a series of stories drawn from the civil war in Greece, with the title Ta agrimia tou allou dasous. But the writer first appeared with the novel To horologi, second edition 1990, in the Greek literature. After that Alaveras published the books To miso tou phengariou (stories, 1960), second edition 1990; To sēmerino syngraphiko provlēma (essay, 1961); Hodostrōtēras, (novel, 1963), second edition 1973, third edition 1988. After a great break, Alaveras publishes the study Diēgēmatographoi tēs Thessalonikēs in 1970, and in 1971 the forerunning play in one act Hoi alloi. Apart from these his main study "Ta logotechnika periodika tēs Thessalonikēs (1880-1955)" ["The literary magazines of Thessalonikē (1880-1995)"] was published in stories to be continued in the early press. In 1976 Alaveras issued seven stories with the title Ap'aphormē (second edition 1978). In 1977 this book received the First State Prize for story-writings. In 1985 he issued the volume of stories with the title Gōnies kai opseis, second edition 1988, which received the Ouranē Prize by the Academy of Athens. In 1987 he published the prose "Archeion" Averkiou Sverkiadē," and in 1990 the book Se eutheia grammē. Taxidi stēn Polōnia. In 1991 this book received the National Chronicle-Witness Award. In 1990 he issued one volume with critical notes in books with the title Sēmeiōseis.</p><p> Alaveras was the editor of the literary magazine Nea Poreia from the day the magazine was issued (1955). He was also the president of the Literary Society of Thessalonikē. He was a member of boards of state organizations and literary competitions, theater, and film-competitions.</p><p> His works have been translated into German, Dutch, Italian, Bulgarian, Swedish, Serbian, and Polish. Tēlemachos Alaveras belongs to the post-war novelists of Thessalonikē and is one of the first writers who exploited the theme of the Greek Civil War period. Married to poet Roula Alavera and had two sons. He died on June 30, 2007.</p>  </bioghist>
