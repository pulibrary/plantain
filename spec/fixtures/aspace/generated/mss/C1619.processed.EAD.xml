    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>José Emilio Pacheco was a poet, essayist, novelist and short story writer. He was born in Mexico City on June 30, 1939. Pacheco attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he studied law and literature and worked for literary publications but did not earn a degree. He later taught at various universities in Mexico, United States, Canada, and England, including the University of Maryland at College Park, and the University of Essex, England. Pacheco also worked as director and editor of various journals and cultural supplements. He was given various awards during his lifetime, including the Premio Reina Sofía de Poesía Iberoamericana, and the Premio Miguel de Cervantes, both in 2009. He died in Mexico City on January 26, 2014.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The papers consist of José Emilio Pacheco's handwritten notebooks, in which Pacheco appears to have recorded draft iterations of his writings, miscellaneous notes, and other information related to his creative process; diaries and journals containing handwritten dated entries; writings, such as drafts, excerpts, addenda, and final versions, including poetry, short stories, scripts, screenplays, essays, articles, and translations; a few writings by others; correspondence from various colleagues, publishers, family, and friends, including Octavio Paz, Juan Vicente Melo, Carlos Fuentes, José Miguel Oviedo, Sergio Galindo, Bruno Arcudi, Félix Grande, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Homero Aridjis, Carlos Monsivaís, Rosario Castellanos, José Bianco, and Vicente Rojo; printed materials, including periodicals, newspaper clippings, articles, publications, and broadsides; and other materials, including photographs, biographical documents, certificates, and materials related to awards given to Pacheco.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>As no original order was discernible, materials were arranged in file groups by type of materials. Additionally, a large number of the writings were undated, untitled, unattributed, and in many cases, drafts and fragments mixed together, which were impossible to separate and identify given the disorganized state of the material upon receipt.</p>  </arrangement>
