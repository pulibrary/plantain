<p>Harold Boies Hoskins was a businessman, diplomat, and educator working in Middle Eastern affairs. Born in Beirut and raised by American missionary parents, he graduated from Hill School in 1913 and Princeton in 1917. Hoskins served in both WWI and II, and in 1942, he was commissioned by President Roosevelt to act as a U.S. diplomatic emissary in Palestine. He became a special assistant to the U.S. ambassador in Tehran in 1944, and served as a counselor for economic affairs at the American embassy in Cairo, and for American diplomatic missions in Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia over the course of his career. From 1955 until his retirement in 1961, he served as director of the Foreign Service Institute.</p>  </bioghist>
