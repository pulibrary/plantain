Lee II, Matter Sent Out photos, and Lee's large collection of autographed photographs that graced his office walls. The photos of Lee span the years of 1881 to 1932. Many of the photos are undated but appear to be taken during the 1920s. There are also four photographs Lee took while at Emory University and photos taken at the ceremonies of Ivy Lee Day in Cedartown, Georgia in 1965. The family photographs contain members of the immediate family and one portrait of a Lee family gathering that includes Lee's brothers and sisters. Also included is a folder of photographs taken on the family trip "Seeing America" in the summer of 1926. The German photos taken by James W. Lee II in 1933 and 19434 are of Nazi rallies that were enclosed in letters to his parents.</p><p> During World War II, Ivy Lee &amp; Assoc. sent photos out with the MSO material. Only selected photographs have been saved since most were exact duplicates. The photos generally highlight the war work being done by various clients. Many of the photos feature women on the assembly line and in other areas of work. The Marine Studios photos are publicity pictures of the building of the world's largest aquarium at the time, including pictures of the marine life that inhabited the new tourist attraction in Florida. There are 6 boxes of autographed photographs, arranged alphabetically, once hung on Ivy Lee's office walls.</p><p> The visual materials series includes a newsreel of Ivy Lee titled This Man Speaks for the Great: Ivy Lee Relates an intimate anecdote for a noted client, John D. Rockefeller, Sr. There is also footage of Ivy Lee, Jr. in an interview with Allen Center discussing Ivy Lee, Sr. recorded in the Spring of 1971.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_a20e058a6cf239e2de7c0ed2bf6eb9a5"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged by type of materials.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_MC085_c1273" level="file"><did><unittitle>Posters</unittitle><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 boxes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1918-01-01/1943-12-31" type="inclusive">1918-1943</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_MC085_c01078" level="file"><did><unittitle>Interborough Rapid Transit</unittitle><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 boxes</extent></physdesc><physdesc altrender="part"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 folder</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1918-01-01/1932-12-31" type="inclusive">1918-1932</unitdate><dao actuate="onRequest" href="https://figgy.princeton.edu/collections/6ff2c854-f102-4a5e-861d-276179a3a5f0/manifest" show="new" title="View digital content" type="simple"><daodesc><p>View digital content</p></daodesc></dao></did></c></c></c></dsc>
